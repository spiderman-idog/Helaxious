# Beep Bop! (Hello there!)

Hello, I'm helaxious, a ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· TV that likes to talk with computers and telling them what to do. Currently making games with Bevy.

Currently using neovim and [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) to code. Loving the :crab: language

Sometimes I code, sometimes I do something else.
