# Beep Bop! (Hello there!)

Hello, I'm helaxious, a ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· TV that likes to talk with computers and telling them what to do. Currently wanting to learn Rust (wish me luck), and thinking on making games with Bevy.

Currently using (and loving) neovim to code. And would use Python as the choice of language (though I rarely use it ðŸ¥²).

Sometimes I code, sometimes I write something on my [blog](https://helaxious.github.io/snake_cases).

Thanks for stopping by, have a look at some of my pinned projects.
